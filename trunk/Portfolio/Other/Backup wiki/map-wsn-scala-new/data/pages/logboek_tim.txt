I searched for a solution and saw that the problem could be that the port is assigned to another process. But it wasn’t. Maybe VMWare was blocking the port, opened it in the NAT. Finally checked de processes in ubuntos (ps ux) and concluded that the process was still running and was causing this problem. So, killed it (kill -9 ‘processnumber’) and the errors were gone.	 
	 
Next problem, it seems that the parser is stuck and isn’t transmitting any data:

Problem solved, a secondary node was missing, but old problem “bindexception” has returned, but the parser successfully transmits data to the controller.	 
	 
Installed MySQL and controller on desktop pc, to run as server for home.	 
Noticed that the controller crashes after 30s,if parser is sending data.	 
	 
	 
TODO:	 
	 
• Fix bug with listeningsocket	 
	 
• Expand xml sheme to the new format	 
	 
• Fix instability of controller.	 
	 
===== 13/02 =====	 
	 
Testing the parser with Peter’s controller: problem of bindexception didn’t occur. So I concluded that the problem  was locally to my computer. The controller also didn’t crash after 30s and was stable.	 
Expanding the XML scheme of  the parser to make room for new data like RSSI, LQI and coordinates. We tested the new parser with the adjusted controller, but there is a problem with the controller if it receives a message from the parser.

Exception in thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/jdesktop/layout/GroupLayout$Group


===== 23/02 =====

Meeting with peter about GUI and application for the telosb nodes + administration (WIP)
Problem solved  by adding some code in build.xml of the project in netbeans:

    <target name="-post-jar">
        <jar update="true" destfile="${dist.jar}">
            <zipfileset src="${libs.swing-layout.classpath}"/>
        </jar>
    </target>
(http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqPackagingMatisseBasedProjects) 

 Netbeans didn’t add the layout to the .jar file which caused the error. When I first entered this error in google they all said that the classpath wasn’t correct, even the FAQ off tinyos (http://www.tinyos.net/faq.html#SEC-15). So I extended the classpath so that it would contain my path of the jar file, but that didn’t do anything. Then I started to look into some existing java app’s in tinyos like AntiTheft. But they didn’t make us of a panel like I did in netbeans. 
Finally I came across a website where someone had a similar problem en guided me to the correct solution.

So the parser receives a messages serial, but the size is not valid.

Something wrong with frequency error, hasn’t been implemented yet

Meeting with peter and testing the GUI. Framework needs to be added with something that can detect failure of a node and reply on a request. Discovered that the reply message wasn’t send properly to the controller (wrong socket).

Solution is to distinguish the status message where it is coming from the type parameter of the statmsg struct. Strangest thing ever: if you send request to node 2 then type will be 4, then node 1 will have type 3, if you make request to node 1 then type will be 4 and the type of node 2 will be 3…
