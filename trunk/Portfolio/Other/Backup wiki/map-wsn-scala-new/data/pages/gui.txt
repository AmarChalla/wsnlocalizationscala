====== GUI======

===== General =====

The GUI will function as a administration tool for the WSN. The goal here is to allow for easier experiments by controlling certain parameters real-time via the dissemination protocol. The GUI also allows us to quickly view RSSI data, and simply graph some of the data, this is however more of a showcase scenario, rather than actually having much use in our thesis. The actual analysis will be done via Excel.

==== Power ====
use a range of 31 to 0:
     Power level   Transmitted power level
     31                0dbm (1 mW)
     27               -1dbm
     23               -3dbm (0.5 mW)
     19               -5dbm
     15               -7dbm
     11               -10dbm
     7                -15dbm
     3                -25dbm
