====Status Message====
===The problem===
What do we need to do with the status of the nodes so that it may assist us in analyzing the localization protocols?

  * Status of the nodes needs to be logged at all times
  * The capability to set the status of the nodes
    * Check the current status so that we do changes nodes status unnecessary
    * Get a confirmation so that we are assured the nodes status has changed

We considered two possibilities for the status message.
