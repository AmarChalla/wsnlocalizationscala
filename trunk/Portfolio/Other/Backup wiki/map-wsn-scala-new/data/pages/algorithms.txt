==Tables==

Note each algorithm that is relevant to our thesis in the following table. Try to fill in each column. Papers that describe an interesting feature/idea or aspect of RSSI, but are of a different kind of algorithm can be described in the 2nd table. In the third table you can fill in paper you have read but were not relevant to our thesis, for example because the used a different kind of ranging. Note that when different ranging techniques are used, the phase 2 algorithm can still be the same, so fill these in the 2nd table. In the fourth table you can note interesting reference that we have not downloaded yet.

==Columns==
For completeness: A phase 1 algorithm/technique maps RSSI-values to distance and thus estimates the range. A phase 2 algorithm uses the information from phase 1 to determine the location, a classic example of this is lateration. When an algorithm describes both phase 1 & 2, simply write 1+2 in the phase column.

THIS TABLE IS STILL A WIP, SO KEEP THE PAPERS AT ARMS LENGTH. 

D/C stands for Distributed/Centralized. In the column, CPU, describe the computational complexity as high, low, med... Write the status of the software in the implementation column, whether or not it is publicly available and for which platform it is written. 

S/0 marks whether this data is gathered from the authors of the algorithm or from a survey. Surveys tend to be less complete but provide interesting results. Original papers tend to overvalue their own algorithm

====Remarks====
  - Keeping in my mind the transmission pattern of the antenna
  - At low transmission power, long distances are poorly estimated | At high power transmission, short distances are poorly estimated (http://www.notere-conf.org/wwsn/WWSN07-Le_Borgne.pdf)
