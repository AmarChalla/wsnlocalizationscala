\section{Conclusion}
This paper has investigated the core aspects of WSN localization systems using RSS and made an overview of the existing localization algorithms. Different types of localization systems were introduced and important properties were discussed as well. An overview of our localization framework and the interface to scalawas given. Five centralized localization algorithms were discussed. The results showed that the relative positioning error was lower then 100\% in most cases and that accuracy improves when more anchor nodes are added. We can conclude that the Min-Max algorithm performs the best in both outdoor and indoor environments.
