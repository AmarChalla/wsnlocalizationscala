[104]. It was concluded in [104] that in general, if in a given sensor network
and distributed algorithm, the average number of
hops to the central processor exceeds the necessary
number of iterations, then the distributed algorithm
will be more energy-efficient than a typical centralized
algorithm.

Localization schemes for wireless ad hoc networks can be classified as
either range-based or connectivity-based depending on what information (e.g.,
distance and angle measurements or proximity contraints) is used to provide
position estimation.
