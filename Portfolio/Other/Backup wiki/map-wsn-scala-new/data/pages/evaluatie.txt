====== Research & evaluation ======

===== Location error distribution =====
x & y axis are distance and the Z axis is the location error / beacon distance (used with CL)

===== Mean localization error versus transmission range =====
x axis is the transission range / beacon distance and the y axis is localization error / beacon distance

===== Orientation =====
x axis is the distance and the y axist is de RSSI, then you different graphs with each orientation.


===== Other =====


Possible parameters include:

Y-Axis

  * Absolute range error
  * Relative range error



X-Axis

  * Time/Number of measurements
  * Total Density
  * Anchor Density
  * Transmission Power
  * Transmission Frequency
  * Node Spreading



Other experiments worth investigating:

  * Antenna radiation pattern
  * RSSI/Battery
  * People nearby...
